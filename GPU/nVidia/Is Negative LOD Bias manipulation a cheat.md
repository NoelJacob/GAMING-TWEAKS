### Texture Filtering - Negative LOD Bias (LOD-BIAS) - Is it cheating or not?

On nVidia graphic cards (GPU's) you can use nVidia Inspector in order to change the [LOD-BIAS offset which make you game look like a cartoon](https://www.hardocp.com/news/2019/01/21/does_adjusting_graphics_settings_lower_than_game_allows_constitute_cheating63/) while I would argue that this has to be patched out of the game (because this can't be used by AMD users and gives you a unfair benefit) I overall say that this doesn't deserves to be banned.

Keep in mind that this isn't allowed in eSports and even a banned topic/"trick" on a normal casual game like Battlefield 5, Overwatch and Quake Champions.

However, it's true that his gives you a massive FPS boost.
