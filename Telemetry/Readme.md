### Integrated Telemetry into games (e.g. DRM, Redshell & Co.) and Game Clients

Some games (not all) including copyright systems like Denuvo (DRM) checks or [Redshell](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQz1d2jf15nHZE8GaRDAWCVMWuYkhip_cwkDUD3fo9dn0EiDRG3crtNXNhPESz8ZLL2KVDULnm9D-VB/pubhtml) in order to spy & log the gamers activity which has an negative impact of the game performance itself ([longer loading times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByfLg9wGB4o), FPS drops or even crashes). A filter-list to prevent such stuff can be found [here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList).

Keep in mind that [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry) has (in normal circumstances) no effect (or less) on the gaming performance (if it was proper implemented) and you should _consider to leave it enabled_ in order to help the game developers (e.g. for crash reports or to improve the anti-cheat mechanism) however, such systems scanning your entire OS and this might invade your privacy. I highly recommend that you read the terms of service before you opt-in.

The biggest impact on the game performance itself is done by the copyright-protection system and its implementation and _can have_ a negative impact which results in longer loading times or _small_ FPS drops. The rumour that Denuvo cripples your performance is not _entirely_ true, it's depending on several factors in most cases you [lose around 2-3 FPS](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/282924-denuvo-really-does-cripple-pc-gaming-performance) (which is considerable not "crippled" - depending how you see it).


### My advice in general is:

- Use [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) releases because they are DRM free, some Epic Game Store and Steam Store Games are also DRM free but the Client itself is not.
- Play cracked versions (_possible malware risk_) or emulate them in a VM/Wine/Sandbbox. You still can support the game developer by buying the game, just don't install it via _official ways_.
- Check if there are _confirmed_ and _clean_ cracks from [trusted groups](https://crackwatch.com/) which avoids losing some performance via VM/Sandbox (as mentioned above) but the risk is still there (!) that you get infected (via re-packs, drive-by, Malvertising etc). _It is up to you._
- Check if you [need the Game Client](https://www.resetera.com/threads/developing-epic-games-launcher-appears-to-collect-your-steam-friends-play-history-epic-responds-see-op.105385/) and read the privacy policy before you install it on your OS!
- Manually removing the analytics code requires to manipulate the game client and it's files and is _dangerous_ because that might result in a ban, the game client should provide an opt-out toggle for such tracking. A better method is to block the request with a firewall/hosts file.


### In which cases Telemetry has no impact on the OS or gaming performance

- Depending how well it was [implemented (example)](https://github.com/matthewhorridge/telemetry), telemetry (the running processes) never uses much resources (_depending how you define "much"_).
- Telemetry can run in the background or even without user consent, the best scenario would be if you can [manually control it opt-in/opt-out](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2014/03/20/instrumenting-your-app-for-telemetry-and-analytics/) and submit only telemetry when you want it
- Checks could be integrated to scan the current running applications and if they are currently in fullscreen or not (e.g games)
- The Telemetry and his task schedule can be configured to run only on specific circumstances e.g. if the PC is idle
- Depending on how big the submitted data are or how small they are you will never notice it (not in-game and not while you use other applications)
